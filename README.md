JCCC_Storefront
===============

Huge semester long project for a class at JCCC.

An online store (like amazon) was created using php, html and javascript. The database and graphics were done by two members of the team, while the php was done by me, the javascript done by another member, with the html aspect done by us both. 

The website features login, saved shopping carts, ability to add and remove from the shopping cart, a checkout system that emails you to notify you're items have been shipped, different payment options, along with custom user interface and search abilites to narrow down items you are looking for.
